            [Intro]
            Yeah
            Yeah, just keep it going, man
            You good (Here we go)
            We all going to come in together like this, here we go

            [Verse]
            Ayy, yo
            Rapping just to rap, what the fuck happened to that?
            Mainstream took a hold of my soul, but I made it back
            Bringin' it back to the roots on some Dat's Dat
            I've rhymed for the love of it, this right here is my covenant
            Since I was a youngin' eatin' cheese from the government
            Come on now, no matter where you at up in the world we on now
            Me and my dogs do it different, yеah, that's on the pound
            If you want to know what we on right now listen to thе sound
            Uh, listen to the sound
            I said I've paid my dues and stayed cool since grade school
            Yeah, you know we bringin' that heat like AU
            Back in the day in G'Burg I was wonderin' wagwan
            Tryna make it out I was a fish in a small pond
            My word is bond, we had somethin' going on
            I played all the parties and sang the la-di-da-dis
            I've picked up the mic and serenaded the hotties
            I drove the Impalas with cats that's had bodies
            I hit the studio, you know I left the track bodied
            I do this shit right here for me, myself and nobody
            Me and my family rollin' deep like Gotti
            Word to John, oh, you know we got it going on
            I'm a silver tongue motherfucker but it never gone
            It goes on and on and on and on and on
            In the studio 'til like five in the mornin'
            Rappin 'til the sun comes up and it's the dawn
            While my homies smokin' more grass than acres on my lawn
            Put on your good clothes, it's showtime at the Apollo
            Shut the fuck up and get to the point like a hollow
            I need the microphone like thirsty bitches need the follow
            I get the pussy wetter than mahalo-halo, ho!
            Aw yeah, you know I'm going beast mode
            These other rappers kiddin' themselves, in vitro
            It's no contest, steppin' to me it's time to rest
            I'm beyond blessed, greatest MC put it to rest for a year
